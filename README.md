# Organize-files-with-Simple-Python-Script
we all use the internet  and download multiples files which are messily arranged in our Downloads directory. So, I thought to write a simple script that manages all the files that are downloaded and arranges the file according to their types.
To get rid of unorganized files in Download or other folder Directory, this Script organizes the file according to their types and move them to clear the cluster in your Directory.

To use this Script Please run it with python3:

1. Copy the above codeblock and paste it into a file named organize_files.py

2. Run this file using $ python organize_files.py <Your Directory> for eg: $ python organize.py /directory/to/organize/
  
  This code is Python3 Compatible & note the / at the last of Directory in Command line arguments.
